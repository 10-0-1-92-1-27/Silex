              <strong>About the publication.</strong>
              <p>When you click on the File menu and then "Publish", I will generate an optimized version of your site, without the data needed by Silex to edit the file. I need a location to put this ready to go version of your site. Use the text input bellow to set the path you want me to use.</p>
              <strong>Hosting your website.</strong>
              <p>If you want to make your site available online, publish to a Dropbox folder, and use a service like <a target="blank" href="http://www.site44.com/">Site 44</a>, <a target="blank" href="http://www.kissr.com/">Kissr</a>, or<a target="blank" href="http://www.paperplane.io/">Paper Plane</a>, to get it live on the web.</p>
              <p>If you want to host your site yourself, publish to a location of your choice, and use an FTP client to transfer all the files to your server. Any web host can host the web sites I publish, since it is only HTML, CSS and Javascript files. In case you need one, Silex Labs foundation recommands these hosting companies:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <a target="blank" href="http://www.ouvaton.org/">Ouvaton</a> and <a target="blank" href="http://www.toile-libre.org/">Toile libre</a>, french non profit organizations with a "pay what you can" policy.
              </li>
              <li>
              <a target="blank" href="">Arvixe</a> which support Silex development since 2010.
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              </p>
              <strong>Advanced users.</strong>
              <p>If you have instaleld Silex (the website editor, not your site) on your own server, you can publish to www/ so that your site will be <a target="blank" href="../">available directly here</a>.</p>
